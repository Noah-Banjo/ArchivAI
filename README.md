# ArchivAI: Blockchain, AI, and ML for Digital Preservation

ArchivAI is a revolutionary framework that integrates blockchain technology and artificial intelligence for digital archiving and preservation. The platform leverages blockchain for document verification and AI for metadata extraction to create a trustworthy digital preservation system.

## üåü Overview

Digital archives today face three critical challenges:
1. **Authentication**: How to verify the authenticity of digital objects in an era of deepfakes and AI-generated content
2. **Resource Limitations**: Managing overwhelming content volume with limited staff and funding
3. **Preservation Silos**: Disconnected systems that complicate consistent authentication

ArchivAI addresses these challenges by integrating blockchain and AI technologies. Our approach is unique because AI plays a direct role in verification - when the system extracts text, identifies entities, generates tags, and creates summaries, these actions become cryptographically verifiable on a blockchain.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

![System Architecture Diagram](images/archivai-system-architecture.png)


ArchivAI consists of five interconnected layers:
- **User Interface Layer**: Tailored interfaces for users, experts, and administrators
- **API Layer**: Manages all interactions between users and backend systems
- **Processing Layers**: 
  - AI Processing Pipeline for content analysis and metadata extraction
  - Blockchain Layer for verification and immutable record-keeping
- **Integration Point**: Where AI-generated data becomes part of blockchain transactions
- **Storage Layer**: Maintains documents, metadata, and blockchain records

## ‚ú® Features

- **Document Upload and Storage**: Securely store documents with unique identifiers
- **AI-powered Metadata Extraction**: Automatically extract relevant information from documents
- **Intelligent Tag Generation**: Generate tags based on document content for easy categorization
- **Entity Recognition**: Automatically identify entities such as people, organizations, dates, emails, etc.
- **Document Summarization**: Create concise summaries of document content
- **Blockchain Verification**: Ensure document authenticity through immutable blockchain records
- **Processing Status Tracking**: Monitor the status of document processing in real-time
- **Search and Retrieval Capabilities**: Easily find documents based on their metadata

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python) REST API
- **AI Processing**: NLTK for natural language processing and metadata extraction
- **Blockchain**: Custom blockchain implementation with cryptographic verification for document integrity
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based metadata storage
- **Frontend**: Simple HTML/JavaScript interface for demonstration purposes

## ‚ùì Possibly Asked Questions

**Q: How does ArchivAI compare to traditional digital preservation approaches?**  
A: ArchivAI enhances traditional approaches by adding blockchain verification for authenticity and AI processing for efficient metadata extraction, addressing both trust and efficiency concerns simultaneously.

**Q: What types of documents can ArchivAI process?**  
A: Currently, ArchivAI can process text-based documents. Support for images, audio, and video is planned for future releases.

**Q: Is ArchivAI suitable for small archives with limited technical expertise?**  
A: While the current prototype requires some technical knowledge to set up, we're working on making the system more accessible for organizations with varying levels of technical expertise.

**Q: How does the blockchain verification work without high energy consumption?**  
A: We use a permissioned blockchain model that avoids resource-intensive "mining," making it more energy-efficient than cryptocurrency blockchains.
